# Data Analysis Project on the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

This project was conducted as part of my data analyst training. Our objective was to analyze the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) to understand the factors influencing the occurrence of pathologies in the United States.

## About BRFSS

The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is a collaborative project between all of the states in the United States, participating territories, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It aims to collect uniform state-specific data on health risk behaviors, chronic diseases and conditions, access to healthcare, and the use of preventive health services related to the leading causes of death and disability in the United States. BRFSS conducts both landline and mobile phone-based surveys with individuals over the age of 18.

## Data Processing

The dataset, BRFSS 2020, was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We began the project with Data Cleaning and Preparation, for which we utilized the Python libraries, pandas, and numpy. We selected 46 relevant columns to retain and removed rows with missing values. Subsequently, we conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis using Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries. We also created a dashboard with Power BI showcasing our most relevant analyses and performed machine learning tasks using Dataiku.

## Conclusions

- The Body Mass Index (BMI) plays a central role in the onset of diabetes.
- Smoking is strongly associated with cardiovascular and pulmonary pathologies.
- Arthritis is deeply linked to age.
- Women are more prone to depression than men.

## Recommendations

In terms of machine learning, several improvements could be integrated, such as incorporating more data or new features. To delve deeper, a comparison with previous years' BRFSS data could be conducted, along with the addition of data on dietary habits. Furthermore, creating an application offering personalized predictions to users could be a promising avenue.
